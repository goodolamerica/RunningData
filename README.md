# RunningData
 This is my first project using the language of R and I specifically chose data I knew a lot about to understand any discrepancies, the overall patterns/trends, and keeping it simple during the cleaning phase. The data consists of races attended (ranges from 5k to half marathons) for each year along with mile pace, overall pace, and finish position overall and within an age group.
 
 
--My main goals for this project:
1) Report back to the runner their trends for mile pace over the course of their career
2) Narrow down seasonal trends that alter their pace
3) Discover which races provided them with their greatest mile pace and finsih positions
4) Which races could find improvement


Note: This project is still in progress
